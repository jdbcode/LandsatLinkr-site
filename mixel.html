					<h3>miXel</h3>
					<p>
						miXel is the image compositing component of the LLR system. It creates cloud-free annual composite 
						images by blending multiple images from the same year together using the overlapping pixel mean 
						and ignoring pixels identified as cloud, cloud shadow, or no data in the ETM+ SLC-OFF images in the calculation (Figure 1). 
						In the case where all overlapping pixels are identified as obscured, the composite pixel is 
						assigned a value of NA. Given a series of directory locations and an area-of-interest (AOI) 
						raster file or xy corner coordinates, miXel looks through the given directories and finds images 
						(and their corresponding cloud masks) that intersect the AOI. It organizes the images by year, and 
						for each, creates a composite image and then clips that image to the extent of the AOI. It creates 
						composites from modeled MSS tasseled cap indices, TM/ETM+ tasseled cap indices, and modeled OLI tasseled cap indices
						and writes them to a user-defined directory as both individual year files and as a time series stack 
						with as many bands as there are years. Figure 2 shows a visual example of miXel mean composting 
						for a single-pixel time series and Figure 3 shows an example of temporal fitting based on mean 
						annual compositing.

						Figure 3. Example of temporal fitting of composite values for a given pixel. Annual compositing along 
						with temporal fitting produces a simplified representation of the pixel's spectral history. In this 
						case the pixel experienced a spectral decline, followed by a recovery, a gradual decline that transitioned 
						to a more rapid high magnitude decline, and finally another recovery.

					<h4 style="margin-top:30px;">Pixel-level adjustment</h4>
					<p>
						If MSS and OLI data are included in the composites, besides spectral calibration at the image level, a pixel-level
						adjustment is also made. This adjustment is made to the annual composites. First, for all annual composite years that 
						are common between MSS and TM and/or ETM+ and OLI a difference image is created. The mean of all difference images (per pixel) is calculated,
						which is considered the mean offset between the two sets of sensors per pixel. This mean difference per pixel is then subtracted or
						added to all MSS and/or OLI composites that were created initially (Figure 4). This is a fine tuning method to better spectrally-temporally
						align very dark and very bright pixels. Figure 5 shows the pre- and post-adjustment pixel offset between sensors as measured by RMSE of
						the overlapping annual composite years for a sample of pixels. We see a slight decrease in RMSE after the pixel-level correction is made.
						This example is from tasseled cap angle composites.
