						 <h3>Examples from NASA DEVELOP</h3>
						 <p>
							 <a href="http://develop.larc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">DEVELOP</a>, part of NASA's Applied Sciences Program, addresses environmental and public policy issues through interdisciplinary
							 research projects that apply the lens of NASA Earth observations to community concerns around the globe. Bridging the gap 
							 between NASA Earth Science and society, DEVELOP builds capacity in both participants and partner organizations to better 
							 prepare them to address the challenges that face our society and future generations. With the competitive nature and growing 
							 societal role of science and technology in today's global workplace, DEVELOP is fostering an adept corps of tomorrow's 
							 scientists and leaders.
						 </p>
						 <p>LLR was used in the following two projects from the NASA DEVELOP node at Colorado State Univeristy, Fort Collins, CO.</p>

						<h3>Example of MSS time series showing phenology pattern</h3>
						<p>
							MSS data is often overlooked because it has lower spatial and radiometric resolution, and records fewer wavelength bands than its successors (TM, ETM+, and OLI).
							However, it adds ~12 years of observation (1972-1984) to the Landsat archive for a total of 43+ years of Earth observation data. This record is unparalleled and is approaching
							an ecologically meaningful length of time to study short-term Earth surface changes. LandsatLinkr makes MSS images relevant and easy to work with by producing synthetic 
							data that matches the qualities and spectral character of TM/ETM+ data. Below is an example of synthetic tasseled cap greenness (similar to NDVI) MSS data that 
							demonstrates its utility for recording phenology in the north eastern US. The time series represents nearly all MSS images that intersect WRS-2 path/row: 014/032. The values 
							are image median post-cloud masking and cropped to WRS-2 path/row: 014/032.

					<h3>Examples of MSS to TM spectral calibration</h3>
					<p>
						To showcase the results of LLR spectral-temporal calibration, three figures are provided. Figure 1 shows a visual 
						comparison of standard tasseled cap planes for MSS (top row) and TM (bottom row) for a sample 
						of pixel values from a coincident image pair. The shape and density of the scatter plots are 
						very similar, particularly for tasseled cap brightness and greenness, with some disparity for 
						wetness. In a similar example, Figure 2 shows an MSS/TM image pair as tasseled cap brightness, 
						greenness, wetness displayed to the red, green, and blue color guns with the same scaling. 
						Notice the close similarity in visual appearance. Finally, Figure 3 displays a time series 
						of calibrated pixel values at a given coordinate for all images included for an example LLR 
						project. Note the smooth blended transition between sensors at their overlap.
