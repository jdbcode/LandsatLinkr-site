					<h3>MSSwarp</h3>
					<p>
						MSSwarp automatically checks georegistration accuracy of MSS images and attempts to 
						improve images with poor positional RMSE (Figure 1). It looks at image metadata on 
						georegistration found in the *VER.txt file accompanying each MSS LPGS image to determine 
						georegistration accuracy. If the overall scene RMSE is > 0.75, the image is selected for 
						improvement. An image-to-image tie-point search and warping procedure based on Kennedy & 
						Cohen (2003) is conducted. More specifically, a geometric reference image is selected automatically 
						by identifying an MSS image with the lowest percent cloud cover and lowest scene RMSE. The 
						procedure then creates a series of spatially corresponding image subsets for both the 
						geometric reference image and the image being adjusted (Figure 2). For each image subset, 
						the dependent image chip is offset from its original position and slide over the reference 
						image chip in single pixel increments. At each adjusted position the cross correlation 
						coefficient for the overlapping area of the image subsets are calculated (Figure 3). The 
						correlation coefficient matrices are evaluated as surfaces where the best matching position 
						between reference and depended image subsets is the apex of a cone representing radially 
						increasing correlation (Figure 4). The cross correlation surfaces are filtered for noise 
						and prominence of the apex to ensure proper fitting. Further, the x and y coordinates of 
						acceptable surfaces are evaluated for their individual contribution to overall RMSE of all 
						position offsets. Points that disproportionately contribute to overall error are removed. 
						This process iterates until either no points exceed the threshold for acceptable error 
						contribution or until the minimum number of points for the warp model is reached. The 
						remaining points are used in a 2nd order polynomial function (gdalwarp; see System 
						requirements section) to spatially warp the dependent image to more closely align with 
						reference image.

						Figure 1. Example of an image with poor georegistration accuracy. Note the offset between 
						the two images, as most evident in the position of the large lake on the western side of 
						the two images. USGS L1T images go through a georegistration process that does a good job 
						of registering images, but high cloud cover, loss or ephemeris data, and poor position recording 
						can decrease position accuracy. The example here is from an L1G  image showing an extreme 
						offset for demonstration purposes. Generally, L1T images have a mean RMSE of only half a pixel 
						(30 meters). Above 3/4 of a pixel, MSSwarp is applied to improve positional accuracy.

						Figure 2. Representation of MSSwarp image sampling and image subsets. Note the spatial 
						difference between the reference and fix image subset for the same geographic center. 
						MSSwarp attempts to automatically determine the x and y coordinate offsets and spatially 
						shift/warp the fix image to align with the reference image.

						Figure 3. Example of the MSSwarp moving window cross correlation analysis for determining 
						the x and y offset between the reference and fix image subset  surrounding a sample point. 
						For each position of the fix image chip the cross correlation between the overlapping area 
						of the reference chip and the fix image chip is assigned to the focal pixel in the correlation 
						result chip.

						Figure 4. Example cross correlation coefficient surfaces from the MSSwarp moving window analysis. 
						The x-y position of the cone apex represents the x-y offset needed to align a given fix image 
						subset to its reference subset, with the center of the matrix equal to 0, 0. Note the filtering 
						decision on whether to use the point in the warping equation or not; only prominent, well defined 
						peaks are included in the warp model.
