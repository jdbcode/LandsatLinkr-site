					<h3>MSScal</h3>
					<p>
						MSScal calibrates MSS images to TM images through modeling of TM spectral indices 
						from the 4 MSS bands. A set of coincident images are used to define the model (Landsat 
						satellites 4 and 5 carried both MSS and TM sensors collecting images simultaneously). 
						MSScal identified MSS/TM image pairs from directories provided by the user. A spatially 
						coincident sample of pixel values are drawn from each image pair and placed in a large 
						database (Figure 1). A separate database is created for each TM tasseled cap index 
						(brightness, greenness, wetness, and angle). The MSS sample includes values from all 4 bands 
						and the TM sample values represent a single spectral index. Multiple linear regression is 
						applied to predict the TM/ETM+ spectral index from the four MSS bands. Since the model 
						incorporates variance introduced by multiple individual MSS/TM relationships, it represents 
						a mean model which can be applied to all MSS images in an LLR project (Figure 2). To 
						showcase the results of the calibration, three figures are provided. Figure 3 shows a visual 
						comparison of standard tasseled cap planes for MSS (top row) and TM (bottom row) for a sample 
						of pixel values from a coincident image pair. The shape and density of the scatter plots are 
						very similar, particularly for tasseled cap brightness and greenness, with some disparity for 
						wetness. In a similar example, Figure 4 shows an MSS/TM image pair as tasseled cap brightness, 
						greenness, wetness displayed to the red, green, and blue color guns with the same scaling. 
						Notice the close similarity in visual appearance. Finally, Figure 5 displays a time series 
						of calibrated pixel values at a given coordinate for all images included for an example LLR 
						project. Note the smooth blended transition between sensors at their overlap.

						Figure 1. Conceptual depiction of LLR calibration model development. MSS and TM coincident 
						image pairs are used to develop an 'aggregated model' to predict TM indices from MSS bands. 
						Each image pair provides a subset of data from which to develop the model. Combining information 
						on the relationship between each image pair provides a mean model with which to apply to all MSS 
						images in LLR project.
